The Context object is typically obtained from an activity or application context. |
| LayoutInflater | A class in Android that is used to create instances of views from XML layout files. The LayoutInflater class can be used to inflate a layout file into a view hierarchy, which can then be added to an activity or fragment. The LayoutInflater class is commonly used in Android to create custom views, to add views to a layout dynamically, and to create reusable UI components. |
| Bundle | A class in Android that is used to store and pass data between different components in an app, such as between activities or between a service and an activity. Bundles can be used to store simple data types such as strings and integers, as well as more complex data structures such as arrays and objects. |
| RecyclerView<br>ViewHolder | A class in Android that is used to hold references to views in a RecyclerView. The RecyclerView.ViewHolder class is responsible for creating and binding views in a RecyclerView, and can be used to optimize the performance of the RecyclerView by reusing views that are no longer visible on the screen. |
| ContentProvider | A class in Android that is used to manage access to a shared set of data, such as a database or file system. Content providers can be used to share data between different apps, and can be accessed using a unique URI. Content providers are commonly used in Android to store and retrieve data, such as contacts, media files, and settings. |
| Broadcast<br>Receiver | A class in Android that is used to receive and handle broadcast messages sent by the system or other apps. Broadcast receivers can be used to respond to system events, such as the battery level changing or the device being rebooted, or to receive custom broadcast messages sent by other apps. Broadcast receivers are commonly used in Android to perform background tasks and update the UI in response to system events or user interactions. |
| IntentService | A class in Android that is used to perform background tasks on a separate thread from the UI thread. The IntentService class provides a simple way to run code in the background and update the UI when the task is complete. IntentService is similar to AsyncTask, but is designed to handle long-running tasks that should continue running even if the app is closed or the device is restarted. IntentService is commonly used in Android to perform network operations, download files, and perform other long-running tasks that could block the UI thread. |
| Retrofit | A library in Android that is used to simplify the process of making HTTP requests and handling responses. Retrofit provides a simple way to define HTTP requests as Java interfaces, and can be used to handle different types of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Retrofit is commonly used in Android to communicate with web services and APIs, and can be integrated with other libraries such as Gson and RxJava. |
| ViewModel | A class in Android that is used to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware way. ViewModels can survive configuration changes, such as screen rotations, and can be used to store data that should not be lost when the UI is destroyed and recreated. ViewModels are commonly used in Android to manage data for activities and fragments, and can be used to communicate between different components in an app. |
| LiveData | A class in Android that is used to observe changes in data and update the UI in response. LiveData is lifecycle-aware, which means that it can automatically update the UI when the lifecycle state of the component changes, such as when the component is paused or destroyed. LiveData is commonly used in Android to manage data for activities and fragments, and can be used to communicate between different components in an app. LiveData can also be used with other libraries such as ViewModel and Room. |
| ViewBinding | A feature in Android that is used to simplify the process of accessing views in an activity or fragment. ViewBinding generates a binding class that contains references to all of the views in a layout file, and can be used to access the views directly in code without the need for findViewById. ViewBinding is similar to Data Binding, but is simpler and more lightweight. ViewBinding is commonly used in Android to create more readable and maintainable code, and to reduce the risk of NullPointerExceptions caused by incorrect view IDs. |
| Room | A library in Android that is used to simplify the process of working with SQLite databases. Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite that allows developers to define database tables and queries using Java or Kotlin classes and methods. Room is designed to be more efficient and less error-prone than raw SQLite, and can be used to manage complex data structures such as relationships between tables. Room is commonly used in Android to store and retrieve data, such as contacts, media files, and settings. |
| ViewModel<br>Provider | A class in Android that is used to create and manage instances of ViewModel objects. ViewModelProvider is responsible for creating a new instance of a ViewModel when it is first requested, and for providing the same instance of the ViewModel to subsequent requests. ViewModelProvider is commonly used in Android to manage data for activities and fragments, and can be used to communicate between different components in an app. ViewModelProvider can also be used with other libraries such as LiveData and Room. |

ConstraintLayout allows developers to define the position and size of UI elements relative to other elements in the layout, and can be used to create complex layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. ConstraintLayout is commonly used in Android to create custom views, to add views to a layout dynamically, and to create reusable UI components. ConstraintLayout is also optimized for performance, and can be used to reduce the number of nested views in a layout. |
| HandlerThread | A class in Android that is used to manage and schedule tasks on a separate thread from the UI thread. HandlerThreads are similar to regular threads, but have a built-in message queue and handler that can be used to post and receive messages between threads. HandlerThreads are commonly used in Android to perform background tasks and update the UI in response to user interactions or other events. HandlerThreads can also be used with other classes such as AsyncTask and IntentService. |
| WorkManager | A library in Android that is used to manage background tasks in a flexible and efficient way. WorkManager can be used to schedule one-time or periodic tasks, and can be used to ensure that tasks are executed even if the app is closed or the device is restarted. WorkManager is designed to be more efficient and less error-prone than other background task management solutions, and can be used to perform tasks such as syncing data, uploading files, and performing network operations. WorkManager is commonly used in Android to perform background tasks and update the UI in response to user interactions or other events. WorkManager can also be used with other libraries such as LiveData and Room. |
